      <h1>About Patch the English Bulldog</h1>
      <p>
        Patch is a 8 year old English Bulldog.
        <br />
        We rescued him in late 2017 and we have never looked back since.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times he can be a real pain in the neck, especially when he is
        begging for food and he doesn't stop barking.
      </p>
